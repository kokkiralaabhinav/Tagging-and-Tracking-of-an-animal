# TAGGING_AND_TRACKING_OF_AN_ANIMAL


## INTRODUCTION:   
                                                            
Every year, thousands of animals go missing, leaving their owners distraught and communities searching for ways to reunite these lost pets with their families. The loss of a pet can have a significant emotional impact on owners and can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression. In addition, missing animals can cause a strain on animal shelters and rescue organizations, which are often overwhelmed by the influx of lost pets.

Currently, there are several methods used to locate missing animals, including posting flyers, searching the neighborhood, and contacting local animal control and shelter services. However, these methods are often time-consuming and can be ineffective in finding lost pets. Moreover, these methods do not provide real-time location data that can help pet owners quickly locate their missing animals.

To address this issue, our project aims to develop a GPS-based system to track and locate missing animals quickly and help their owners find them. Our system will provide real-time location data for animals equipped with tracking collars, which can be accessed by pet owners through a user-friendly mobile app. By using this system, pet owners can quickly locate their missing animals and reunite with them, reducing the emotional and psychological impact of pet loss. Moreover, the system can help reduce the burden on animal shelters and rescue organizations by facilitating the return of lost pets to their families.

## METHODOLOGY:
To develop our GPS-based animal location system, we followed a multi-step process that included designing and implementing software and hardware components, conducting testing and validation, and collecting and analyzing data.

### Hardware Development:
                           We developed a cellular based tracking collar for animals that incorporates a GPS receiver and a wireless communication module to transmit location data to a central server. The collar was designed to be lightweight and durable.

### Software Development:
                           We developed a user-friendly algorithm that allows owners to request through the message app to get the google map link of its location to view the location of their missing animal on a map, set up geofencing boundaries, and receive notifications when their pet leaves a designated area. We also developed a backend server to receive and store location data from the tracking collars.

### Testing and Validation:
                         We conducted extensive testing of the tracking collar and mobile application to ensure they are reliable and accurate in locating missing animals. We tested the system in a variety of environments, including urban and rural areas, and under different weather conditions. We also conducted user testing to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the mobile application.

### Data Collection and Analysis:
                    We collected and analyzed data on the performance of the tracking collar and mobile application, including location accuracy, battery life, and user feedback. We also collected data on the number of animals that were located using our system and the time it took to locate them.

### Design Specifications

### Color of the product:
    Orange is a common color used for animal trackers, such as radio collars and ear tags, for several reasons:

### High Visibility: 

Orange is a highly visible color, especially in natural environments like forests and grasslands. This makes it easier for researchers and wildlife managers to locate animals from a distance.

### Safety: 

Orange is also a standard color for safety equipment, such as life jackets and cones. Using orange for animal trackers can help reduce the risk of accidental harm to the animal by alerting hunters or other individuals to the presence of the tracker.

### Standardization: 

Many wildlife agencies and researchers use standardized colors for tracking devices to aid in identification and data collection. Orange is often used alongside other colors like green, blue, and yellow, depending on the species being tracked and the purpose of the study.

Overall, using orange for animal trackers is a practical choice that helps ensure the safety and visibility of both the animals and the researchers studying them.

Attachment mechanism
       In an Indian context the cattle owner puts a rope around its the neck. so, we are planning to attach our device on the rope using mechanism similar to a hose clamp
this is better method as

•	It avoids hurting animal

•	Easy to attach

•	make device more functional
